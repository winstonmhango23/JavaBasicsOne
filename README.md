This is a repository of code samples of the Java basics am covering from different courses to level up my Java knowledge and experiences. This is the first lessons from one course.
Feel FREE to download and walk through the code , and perharps you might find them usefull, however, I advise that you take a reading to understand the code, as am not providing enough explanations in the comments that accompany the code.
